#Introduction





This project aims to integrate the skills and concepts learned in the first two projects into a
comprehensive Information Retrieval (IR) chatbot.


Project 1: Indexing and Crawling - Focused on gathering data from Wiki Pages, students learned to
index this data effectively using Apache Solr.


Project 2: Scoring - Explored the mechanics of building your own inverted index from scratch and
retrieving documents using AND queries.


Project 3: End-to-End IR Chatbot.
